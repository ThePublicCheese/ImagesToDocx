Running the script:

Download any python release for windows : https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

After install, you're gonna run everything in windows commandline (type cmd in the search bar) make sure you have pip by typing "python -m pip --version", if not try "python -m ensurepip --upgrade", otherwise just look it up LMFAO

Then, install the script dependency with "pip install python-docx"

and now you're good to go, select the scripts directory "cd 'your\directory\here'" 
(might look like "C:\Users\SuperCoolGuy\Downloads\PPTimageToDocXStudySheet"

and run "python docxformatter.py" then you should be all setup!



Usage:

~bundled with example images~, replace with other pics and then run the script

After running the script, 

select the table,
then table layout,
then properties,
set the alignment to "center"
set row height to 0.1 and set row height to "exactly"

at this point, every image should have just combined into a horrible mass of images in your doc! if not, keep messing around until it does
Now the manually change the height and you should see a wall of images form before you and you can get a doc like the reference!


If you have less images for a sheet, or want to change anything, the script has modifiable values to change the output
